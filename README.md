Hello, 

First of all, thank you for giving at least a glance to my repository. 
In order to make it easier for you to search inside my projects, I highly recommend looking at the last folders to view more complexly developed ones.

If you have any doubt or have suggestions to improve any line of my code do not hesitate in letting me know, I would be thankful if you do it :)

Juan Manuel.
